# flo-exchange

This is an order matching algorithm website code inspired by "Bitcoin Exchange Project" 
by David Veksler (http://automagical.rationalmind.net/2013/10/16/bitcoin-order-matching-algorithm/).

The algorithm, however, may not exactly work same as David's as it was modified a little to meet Ranchi Mall's 
Florincoin Exchange project.

The script contains basic functionalities of buying, selling and market order of, in fact, any article that can be traded online 
(Florincoin tokens in our case). The system also contains a basic Facebook authentication system to store users basic information. 
It is currently a singe page website with basic display of users, transactions and other important features that an exchange site 
is expected to have.
